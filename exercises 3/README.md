# Laboratory 3

This repository contains the 3th mandatory exercises for the Algorithms and Data Structures I laboratory course.

## Exercises
### Transpose of a square matrix

Given a square matrix, it should be modified to obtain its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping rows and columns.

### Triangular matrix

Given a square matrix, it should be determined whether it is triangular, either lower or upper. A lower triangular matrix is one in which all elements above the main diagonal are zero. An upper triangular matrix is one in which all elements below the main diagonal are zero.

### Rotate a string

A function should be implemented that takes a string and an integer $j$, and returns the string rotated $j$ times to the right. For example, if the string is `"hello"` and $j = 3$, the function should return `"llohe"`.

### Subsequence of strings

Given two strings $s$ and $t$, it should be determined whether $s$ is a subsequence of $t$, i.e., if all characters of $s$ appear in $t$, not necessarily consecutively. For example, if $s = \text{"ace"}$ and $t = \text{"abcdec"}$, the function should return `true`, but if $s = \text{"abdc"}$ and $t = \text{"abcecde"}$, the function should return `false`.

Each exercise will be implemented in its respective file within this repository.
