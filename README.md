# Algorithms and Data Structures I

This repository contains C++ implementations of the algorithms seen in the theoretical and practical classes. This course aimed to introduce the world of programming, starting from first-order logic to specify problems and advancing to the understanding of time complexity and fundamental data structures such as vectors and matrices. Additionally, it covers various search and sorting algorithms, as well as a Testing module to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the implementations.
