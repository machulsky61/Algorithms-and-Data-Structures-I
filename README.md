# Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains **C++** implementations of the algorithms seen in the theoretical and practical classes. This course aimed to introduce the world of programming, starting from **_first-order logic_** to specify problems and advancing to the understanding of **_time complexity_** and fundamental data structures such as vectors and matrices. Additionally, it covers various **_search and sorting algorithms_**, as well as a **_Testing_** module to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the implementations.
